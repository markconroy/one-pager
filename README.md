one-pager
=========

A simple one page website with a contact form.

I often get asked to create small websites - the kind that don't need a CMS or anyting like that. This is my attempt at creating a boilerplate for these type sites. I don't like to say no, because they are great ways for learning new things.

If you use this, a link back would be nice. If you don't want to link back (or can't for whatever reason), that's fine too.

Have a nice day!

Credits go to fTutorials and TangledinDesign for the original php code for the contact form that kicked off this project
